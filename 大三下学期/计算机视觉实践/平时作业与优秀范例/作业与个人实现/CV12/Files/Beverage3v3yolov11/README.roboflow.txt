The dataset includes 983 images.
Bottle-v00R-4pbb-JJvo are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 15 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
